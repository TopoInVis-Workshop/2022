# Call for Papers

Contact: <...@precisionconference.com>

Topology-based methods are of increasing importance in visual analysis of data 
from a wide variety of scientific domains, each involving its own challenges. 
Typical challenges of topology-based techniques include dealing with large, 
complex, and time-dependent data, characterizing noise and uncertainty, as well 
as developing efficient and robust numerical methods. 


TopoInVis is a well-established workshop in the field of topological methods in 
visualization. It welcomes fully developed visualization solutions based on 
topology as well as more foundational work in the field of topological data 
analysis. Previously eight successful workshops have taken place in this series: 
Slovakia in 2005, Germany in 2007, USA in 2009, Switzerland in 2011, USA in 2013, 
Germany in 2015, Japan in 2017, and Sweden in 2019. This is the first workshop 
to be held in conjunction with IEEE VIS 2022.

## Scope

Workshop topics include:

* scalar/vector/tensor/multi-field field topology
* topology of point sets and cell complexes
* theoretical models
* combinatorial methods and robustness
* multi-scale representation models
* time-dependent methods
* feature extraction
* Lagrangian coherent structures
* topology-based denoising and simplification
* topological similarity and correlation
* user interfaces and visualization
* domain-specific interpretation of topological constructs and results
* efficiency of topological algorithms
* open implementations of topological algorithms

## Submission

The manuscripts should be formatted according to 
[guidelines from IEEE VGTC](http://vgtc.org/publications/conference). 
Submission of an abstract is required prior to submission of a paper. 

Papers should have a maximum length of 9 pages with up to two (2) 
additional pages allowed for only references (maximum total of 11 
pages). Full papers may make contributions in techniques, systems, 
applications, evaluations, or theory. The contributions of full papers 
are reviewed based on their novelty, contribution, replicability, and 
evaluation.

## Proceedings

The proceedings of the symposium will be published together with the VIS 
proceedings and via the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. 

## Best Paper

The TopoInVis Program Committee will present a Best Paper award to the 
authors whose submission is deemed the strongest according to the 
reviewing criteria. This award will be announced in conjunction with VIS 2022. 

## Important Dates

Please note: all deadlines are firm and no extensions will be granted.
