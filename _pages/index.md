# TopoInVis 2022 - Topological Data Analysis and Visualization

Topology-based methods are of increasing importance in visual analysis of data 
from a wide variety of scientific domains, each involving its own challenges. 
Typical challenges of topology-based techniques include dealing with large, 
complex, and time-dependent data, characterizing noise and uncertainty, as well 
as developing efficient and robust numerical methods.

TopoInVis is a well-established workshop in the field of topological methods in 
visualization. It welcomes fully developed visualization solutions based on 
topology as well as more foundational work in the field of topological data 
analysis. Previously eight successful workshops have taken place in this series: 
Slovakia in 2005, Germany in 2007, USA in 2009, Switzerland in 2011, USA in 2013, 
Germany in 2015, Japan in 2017, and Sweden in 2019. This is the first workshop 
to be held in conjunction with IEEE VIS 2022. 

To attend TopoInVis, please register through the [IEEE VIS website](http://ieeevis.org).
